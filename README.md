Wireframe
=========

An approach to create a CMS with acl permissions, feel free to fork.
Wireframe originally created by Christian Harz and Arthur Mayer.
License pending, Wireframe is open source and makes use of open source frameworks like Jquery and Twitter Bootstrap.

Todo:
	Bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes
	Template engine (currently pure php/html)
	Plugin API (partially done)
	Installer
